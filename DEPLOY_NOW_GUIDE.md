## ⚡ **Step 2: Add Environment Variables (2 minutes)**

### **🔧 Configure MongoDB:**
```
1. In Railway dashboard, click on your deployed project
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Add these variables:

   MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://your-connection-string
   NODE_ENV = production
   PORT = 3000
```

### **🎯 Get MongoDB Connection String:**
```
Option A - MongoDB Atlas (Recommended):
1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Create free account / login
3. Create new cluster (free tier)
4. Get connection string
5. Replace password in string

Option B - Quick MongoDB Setup:
1. Use Railway's MongoDB addon:
   - Click "Add Service" 
   - Select "MongoDB"
   - Railway will auto-create connection string
```

## ⚡ **Step 3: Enable Auto-Deploy (1 minute)**

### **🔄 Configure Auto-Updates:**

3. Under "Source" section:
   ✅ Auto Deploy: ON
   ✅ Branch: main  
   ✅ Root Directory: /
4. Click "Save"
```

**🎉 Now every `git push` will auto-deploy your bot!**

---

## ⚡ **Step 4: Deploy & Test (2 minutes)**

### **🚀 First Deployment:**
```
1. Railway should show "Building..." then "Deployed"
2. Check "Deployments" tab for build logs
3. Look for "✅ Build succeeded" message
4. Bot will start automatically
```

### **📱 Connect WhatsApp:**
```
1. Go to Railway project → "Logs" tab
2. Look for QR code in logs (may take 30-60 seconds)
3. Scan QR code with WhatsApp:
   - WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link Device
4. Once connected, bot is live! 🎉
```

## 🎯 **Test Auto-Deployment**

### **🔄 Verify Auto-Updates Work:**
```bash
# Make a small test change locally
echo "// Auto-deploy test - $(date)" >> baileys-bot.js

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Test auto-deployment"
git push origin main

# Watch Railway automatically deploy:
# 1. Railway detects push (within 30 seconds)
# 2. Starts new build (2-3 minutes)
# 3. Deploys new version
# 4. Bot restarts with changes
```
